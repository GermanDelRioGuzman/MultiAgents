# Part 1: Multiagent Systems

In this section, the primary objective is to program your five robots to organize a chaotic warehouse. 
Each robot is equipped with advanced traction and manipulation capabilities, allowing them to travel across different terrains, pick up objects, and stack them in groups of up to five.

- Initialize the starting positions of multiple objects, which can be distributed across various levels.
- Randomly place all robots in empty grid cells at the beginning of the simulation.
- Track and analyze the performance by collecting data on the total time taken to sort the objects and the number of movements each robot makes. You should also explore strategies to enhance the robots' efficiency in their sorting tasks
