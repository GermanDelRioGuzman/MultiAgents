# Part 3: Computer Vision

In the final part, the focus shifts to utilizing computer vision technology to enhance the robots' capabilities in identifying objects for stacking. Here, each robot must be equipped with a camera that streams visual data to a processing model that can recognize objects, through advanced models like YOLO.

- Implemented the camera setup, which is positioned following the agent to best capture the environment.
- Ensuring that when a robot detects an object, it communicates this observation through a signal, such as displaying a text prompt to indicate the detection of an object.
- This implementation aims to improve the robots' operational context and decision-making as they interact with the environment
