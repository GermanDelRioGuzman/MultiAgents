# Part 2: Computer Graphics
Building on the previous part, this section emphasizes the visual representation of the warehouse and robots through 3D modeling. 

## Key tasks include:
- Created 3D models of the shelves, items, and at least five robots.
- Programmed animations that enable the robots to navigate appropriately through the warehouse.
- Implemented lighting features, such as a directional light source and movable point lights on each robot to enhance visibility.
- Established basic collision detection to ensure robots can navigate without colliding with each other during their tasks
