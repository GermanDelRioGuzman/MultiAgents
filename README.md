# MultiAgents
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a multi-agent robotic system aimed at organizing a warehouse. The entire setup will be visualized in a 3D environment utilizing computer graphics, while object recognition will be powered by computer vision technologies.


## Part 1: Multiagent Systems
In this part, the team programmed five robots to organize a disordered warehouse filled with objects. The robots can move in any direction, pick up and stack objects, and detect their surroundings. The main goal is to sort all items into groups of a maximum of five objects. Key elements of the simulation include initializing starting positions, tracking the time taken for sorting, and the number of movements made by each robot while exploring strategies for efficiency in their operations.


## Part 2: Computer Graphics
This phase involved creating a 3D representation of the warehouse and the robots. Designed various components, such as shelves, objects, and robots, applying materials and textures. Implemented robot movement across the warehouse and ensured collision detection. At last, we included lighting elements, including directional and point lights on each robot.


## Part 3: Computer Vision
In the final part, the focus is on using computer vision to identify objects being manipulated by the robots. Each robot, equipped with a camera, will send visual data to a vision model, utilizing YOLO framework. 


Overall, the project emphasizes the integration of multiagent systems, computer graphics, and computer vision to create an efficient warehouse organization solution.
